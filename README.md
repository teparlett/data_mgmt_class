# data_mgmt_class
This branch contains all the data used for my Data Management final project.

Raw Data includes four datasets downloaded from the US Census Bureau and USDA ERS.

Data To Merge includes the same four datasets after they were cleaned.

The logs for cleaning these datasets is in the Cleaning 1 folder.

The folder Merged Dataset contains the result of the four datasets being merged and cleaned.

The record of the merge and cleaning is in the Merging folder.

Cleaning 2 is the log of cleaning the merged dataset when I separated it into three datasets for analysis.

The Regressions folder contains the regression output for each of the three models analyzed.

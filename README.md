## Data Management Main Project
This project will look at issues in rural US counties. After several setbacks, I plan to look at the effects of several factors, including the Gini inequality index, on the overdose rate in rural counties. Currently, the project is not very far along, but I will be inputting more data sources, as the limitations of previous sources held me up considerably.
The project is made up of a series of Take Home Assignments (THAs)
### THA1 
THA1 is a notebook file in which a few datasets were merged. In the next couple weeks I plan to supplement this with a new set of datasets that I will clean and merge in another notebook file. 
### THA2 
THA2 was mainly the process of uploading THA1 to this repository and the creation of this README file. Since the direction of my research has changed, there is no complexity to lay out for clarity, simply another notebook file of data sources that I am in the process of collecting.
### THA3 and THA4 
THA3 and THA4 are still to come. This file will be updated accordingly.

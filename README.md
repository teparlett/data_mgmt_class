## Data Management Main Project
This project will look at issues in rural US counties. After several setbacks, I plan to look at the effects of several factors, including the Gini inequality index, on the overdose rate in rural counties. Currently, the project is not very far along, but I will be inputting more data sources, as the limitations of previous sources held me up considerably.
The project is made up of a series of Take Home Assignments (THAs)
### THA1 
THA1 is a notebook file in which a few datasets were merged. In the next couple weeks I plan to supplement this with a new set of datasets that I will clean and merge in another notebook file. 
### THA2 
THA2 was mainly the process of uploading THA1 to this repository and the creation of this README file. Since the direction of my research has changed, there is no complexity to lay out for clarity, simply another notebook file of data sources that I am in the process of collecting.
### THA3 
THA3 is a dataset meant to look at rural brain drain by correlating the rurality of a given county with the net migration to that county. It merged two datasets, one of rural/urban lookups from the 2010 Census, and one of the factors in population change from the 2017 ACS. 
###THA4
THA4 is still to come.
